# Goggles
This is just a basic style re-creation of the Google Search Engine, namely, Goggles, With a few features I have tested it with.

Features: 
1. It basically redirects whatever you type in the search bar to the Google search engine and displays your result.

2. Being able to switch to "Dark-Mode" by double clicking on the Googles Logo, and single clicking to switch back to "Light Mode".
